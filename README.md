# dotfiles
My dotfiles for anyone to use

### Credits :- thecountrox :)

My dwm config is heavily based on the gruvbox color scheme 
all of the dwm related things are 
features from one of my friend's dwm build will be seen here

# Dependencies

1) libxft-bgra-git (from aur)
2) ttf-joypixels (from arch community repo)

# Optional Dependencies

1) picom-jonaburg-fix (or picom-jonaburg-git both are from the aur)
2) nitrogen (for wallpapers)
3) maim (from arch community repo)
4) flameshot (from community repo)
5) pulsemixer (from community repo)

# Installation
If u wanna use em the lazy way , (JUST USE THE SCRIPT INSTEAD!!) 
1) copy em to /opt/ 
2) then cd into each one of em and run "sudo make clean install".
3) Swag

This is now done by the install_dotfiles.sh script in this repo (requires git installed)

The script will not install the Dependencies for you (for now...)
however the install_dependencies.sh will install dependencies (or atleast try to)
if u have a sensible aur helper it would work flawlessly
